What we have to do.txt
======================

This the last hand scratched list for integrating powershell and NMP before I was
diverted to razor, and then Csx

	o	Add PSMacros to NMP
	o	Create script block from NMP
	o	Block level define script block for powershell
	o	Allow $ as first char but do not allow as part of macro name
	o	Callback and PS Stuff
	o	NMP invoke and output
	o	PS macros

Work on input.cs just because

	NEED TO TRACK WHERE WE ARE FOR DEBUGGING

		o	this will not just be in input but have its hooks everywhere
			so it needs to be some data attached to a macro invocation record
		
		?	some sort of stack of locations leading from the current byte of input thru various
			macro invocations
				
				macro name
				macro souce file name
				line in macro
				line in source file


Must complete a simple main routine in Nmp

Must complete a basic NmpHost so we can test whatever else we're doing !
